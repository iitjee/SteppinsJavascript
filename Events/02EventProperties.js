Once you register and capture an event, you'll receive an event object back from the browser. The object you get might look different 
depending on the version of the browser you're using. And that's important to remember, because you won't always be able to use all this 
information. The data you receive will also depend on the type of event you requested. But there's a lot of info that's common to all 
events. You can get a lot of info about your event, and the browser environment, so let's take a look at some of the information we get 
back from the event object. I'm going to go back to the code for this page, and instead of just hitting an Alert right here, I'm going to 
use console log.

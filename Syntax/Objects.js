/*  Object Creation */
var player = new Object();
player.name = "fred";
player.score = 1000;

//shorthand way
var player = {name: "Fred", score: 1000}


//JS is dynamically typed language:
We didn't even defined the type of player object. This is the beauty of a dynamically typed language.
You can completely change the shape of an object at any time.

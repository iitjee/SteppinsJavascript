#lesson1.1 jQuery EsseTrain

/* NEW JQUERY METHOD */
    <!-- insert the script to reference jQuery here -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../jquery-3.0.0.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $("document").ready(function() { //callback function
            $("#contenttt").append("<p>The page just loaded.</p>");
        });
    </script> 

//in body tag
    <div id="contenttt"> this is jquery testing</div>
      


/* OLD METHOD */
// Inserting content the old way using the DOM
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(evt) {
    var elem = document.getElementById("content");
    var para = document.createElement("p");
    var text = document.createTextNode("The page just loaded.");
    para.appendChild(text);
    elem.appendChild(para);
});

        $ ----- represents the jQuery library 
        
        And Im using the "document" keyword, which 
        indicates that were about to perform an operation on the page itself. 
      
jQuery's ready() vs nativeHTML's onload
The ready function sets up an event listener for when the DOM structure of the page is fully parsed by the browser, and is 
ready to be operated on. Now, this is different from the onload event, which you might be used to using, because onload 
fires only after all of the page content, including images, have been loaded.

Now obviously, depending on how many images you have, and how big they are, that can take a while. The ready event allows us 
to operate on the page much earlier than the load event does. So, I pass a CALLBACK function to the ready function, and this 
callback function is the event handler that will be fired when the ready event is triggered.
